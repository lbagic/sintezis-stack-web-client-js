## Task Overview

### Closed ❌

- Store helpers (collection management)
  - collection utils should not implemented directly on store, they are better off served as an independant module so they can be reused anywhere, not just in store

### Proposed 💬 (To discuss)

- Documentation
- Internationalization support
- Modal component
- Date formatter
- Table component
- Loading interceptors and loaders
- Carousel component
- Input options
- Input placeholder
- Grpc handler updates - so `.then((res) => res.toObject())` can be omitted

### Exploring 🧠 (Refinement)

- Admin panel theme

### Accepted 🖥 (In development)

### Released 🚀 (Ready for use)

- Toast component
- Store
- GRPC & API
- Project development dettings
- Linter
- SCSS framework
- Input component
- Button component

### Recommended ✅ (Battle tested)
